This script creates a Windows NTP server that propes pool.ntp.org as upstream NTP servers.

Both files ("Create-NTPServer.ps1" & "Setup.bat") are needed.

Move both files to the NTP server and place them in the same folder.

To run the script duble click the "Setup.bat" file and it will run the "Create-NTPServer.ps1" script with the right parameters.
